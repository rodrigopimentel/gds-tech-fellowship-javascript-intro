// Coding Challenge: JavaScript Introduction
// VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers. Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”

let myVariable1 = 10, myVariable2 = 4;

console.log(`The difference between ${myVariable1} and ${myVariable2} is ` + (myVariable1 - myVariable2));
